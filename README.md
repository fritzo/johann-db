Johann-DB
---------

A lightweight tool for reading Johann dababases.

The [http://github.com/fritzo/Johann Johann] system
is a toolset for reasoning about combinatory algebras.
It includes both logical deductive algorithms (theorem-proving)
and statistical analysis algorithms for large combinatory databases.
Johann can be used to build large database of combinators
--essentially multiplication tables for functional programs.

The [http://github.com/fritzo/johann-db Johann-DB] library
allows other programs to use the combinator databases created by Johann.
